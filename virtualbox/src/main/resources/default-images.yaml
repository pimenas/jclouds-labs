                      ## Partitioning example
                      # If the system has free space you can choose to only partition that space.
                      # This is only honoured if partman-auto/method (below) is not set.
                      # Alternatives: custom, some_device, some_device_crypto, some_device_lvm.

                      # Alternatively, you may specify a disk to partition. If the system has only
                      # one disk the installer will default to using that, but otherwise the device
                      # name must be given in traditional, non-devfs format (so e.g. /dev/hda or
                      # /dev/sda, and not e.g. /dev/discs/disc0/disc).
                      # For example, to use the first SCSI/SATA hard disk:
                      #d-i partman-auto/disk string /dev/sda
                      # In addition, you'll need to specify the method to use.
                      # The presently available methods are:
                      # - regular: use the usual partition types for your architecture
                      # - lvm:     use LVM to partition the disk

                      # Depending on what software you choose to install, or if things go wrong
                      # during the installation process, it's possible that other questions may
                      # be asked. You can preseed those too, of course. To get a list of every
                      # possible question that could be asked during an install, do an
                      # installation, and then run these commands:
                      #   debconf-get-selections --installer > file
                      #   debconf-get-selections >> file

                      ### Running custom commands during the installation
                      # d-i preseeding is inherently not secure. Nothing in the installer checks

                      # preconfiguration file like this one. Only use preconfiguration files from
                      # trusted locations! To drive that home, and because it's generally useful,
                      # here's a way to run any shell command you'd like inside the installer,
                      # automatically.
                      
                      # This first command is run as early as possible, just after

                      # This command is run immediately before the partitioner starts. It may be
                      # useful to apply dynamic partitioner preseeding that depends on the state
                      # of the disks (which may not be visible when preseed/early_command runs).

                      # still a usable /target directory. You can chroot to /target and use it
                      # directly, or use the apt-install and in-target commands to easily install
                      # packages and run commands in the target system.
